            <Label
                Text="One of the main reasons we use kinesiology tape is to help people with muscle stimulation after an injury. The thin, stretchy tape imitates the skin’s elasticity, so it feels very natural. When you apply the tape, the skin sends signals to the nerves to activate the muscles. When the muscles receive that information, they respond to the stimulation and contract. Muscle contractions produce movement, sustain body posture and position and help stabilize joints."

            <Label
                Text="In addition, kinesiology tape is used to relieve pain from inflammation and lymphedema. It’s applied in a way that pulls the skin upward, creating a space under the skin that improves the lymphatic flow in that area. It may also help prevent arthritic inflammation from flaring, but there is little evidence to support that and it is even less beneficial if the condition is chronic or mobility is a problem."

In my opinion, the material is too soft, so it doesn’t create enough stability. There is no conclusive research to support its use in this area. People may want to ask their provider about using the more rigid support adhesives for these particular issues instead."
